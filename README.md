Repository for the web-based game being developed live, on-stream at http://twitch.tv/thewizardllewyn Tuesday and Friday nights 9:30pm EST - 11:30pm EST

In this repo there will be the documenation for the design of the game as well as all of the code.  It requires a server with PHP to host, and a mySQL database, otherwise you're welcome to modify and run your own instance of the game.
